"""Control-plane run service (PRD FR-8, FR-9, FR-11).

Reuses Project 1's execution primitives from ``app.agent.service`` (claim,
resolve version, run the workflow, finalize, timeout self-heal) rather than
duplicating them (Decision D5). This module adds the control-plane surface on
top: a list query with agent-version/status filters, an explicit run creator
that validates publication, and an operator/API-level status transition that
enforces the lifecycle state machine.
